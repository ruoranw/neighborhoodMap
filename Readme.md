# Neighborhood Map

This project shows a google map showing places at downtown Los Angeles. It's based on MVVM structure. It used knockout framework to connect the view and javascript. It also used Foursquare API and google map API and streetview to show the infomation of one place. When the user clicked on the markers, the infowindow opened to show the photo and Foursquare info of the place. It is the same if the user clicked on one place at the list view. There is a filter at the list view where the user can search a specific place by its name. The list view is toggled by a hamburger logo. The list showed when hover over the logo.

The map view can be adjusted according to different device including phone , ipad and desktop.
